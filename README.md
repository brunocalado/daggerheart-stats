# Daggerheart: Statistics

<p align="center"><img width="900" src="assets/images/avatar.webp" alt="Avatar"></p>

## What is it?
This module tracks rolls made by the GM (d20) and the players (Duality Dice). It automatically calculates Fear gains, critical hits, and rolls involving Hope and Fear.

## Why?
Reviewing the session's dice rolls is a great way to wrap up the night. Additionally, GMs can use this data to spot players who struggled with poor rolls and may need a special moment in the upcoming session.
